# analysis_quizzes
My Analysis H quizzes from the 2018–2019 school year, in PDF format. Quizzes with my pencil answers on them—basically raw off the scanner—are found in **raw_assembled**, split into **sem1** and **sem2** (first and second semesters). The blanked quizzes, with the answers manually removed, are found in **blanked_assembled**, again split into the two semesters.

tl;dr: answers in **raw_assembled**. Blank quizzes in **blanked_assembled**. You can just click the corresponding links in the table below. Enjoy!

†Contains a non-calculator section (first four pages) and a calculator section (last two pages). Again, the first section was turned in before the second section was given.

‡They accidentally labelled it as "Matrix Quiz 3" on the paper.

\*\*This quiz is Brandon's, not mine. His scanner is far superior!

### A Thought on Blanking Quizzes

This is tedious. Christine later informed me that usually the quiz taker is not the one who blanks them; this task is undertaken by others. Oops!! In total, six hours of my life were whisked away.

### Other Info

I'm not 100% sure about the copyright status of these files, but since the teachers seem to endorse scanning in old quizzes, and I don't care, do whatever you want with them. It would be nice of you, though, if you don't claim this is your work; I spent a bit too long on this and kind of regret it now.

If you find any pressing issues, feel free to send me an email at timothy.herchen@gmail.com or make a GitHub issue or message Ovinus Real on Facebook. Or do nothing... I thought the last year's quiz trade was more intense than it really is. Oops!

### For Personal Documentation

Requires: Python 2 or 3, Bash, *pdfunite* (from poppler)

test name = encoded name of the test, matching /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+./

page # = number starting at 1, maximum 9 inclusive

raw/blank = single page PDF files manually generated by VueScan or Pixelmator for each test. Format: [test name]_[page #].pdf.

organize_quizzes.sh = takes all the tests in a folder and organizes them into sem1/sem2, then renames a few of them (see file)

assemble.py = takes in a source folder and destination folder as sys.args, then uses pdfunite to combine single pages into the multipage PDFs

assemble_[raw/blanked]_pdf.sh = application of assemble.py and organize_quizzes to make the raw and blanked PDFs, respectively.
